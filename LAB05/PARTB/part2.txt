 1.What is the maximum and minimum distances that these sensors can read?
The maximum distance is 1201 cm or 474 inches and the minimum is 0.
2. What kinds and sizes of objects give better more accurate measurements.
The flatter objects such as your hand or a wall give better measurements to me as they cover a wider range.
3. What type of surface or size of objects are harder to get accurate reading from?For instance, compare readings from pointing the sensor strait at computer monitor verses someone wearing a soft fluffy loose fitting hoodie. We are measuring using reflected sound that hast come back in the direction of the sensor.
Smaller objects or rounder objects are more difficult to read as the sound waves can receive multiple values at the same time.
