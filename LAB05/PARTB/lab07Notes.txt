Some problems I found throughout this was finding out what exact parts of the example code served what purpose. I needed to mess with different components of the code from the delay to the steps left. Furthermore, I also had trouble handling the wiring and figuring out how to make it run smoothly. The hardest area to work on was part b number 3 as it was important to make random values for the degrees and make it run randomly so it spun at random degrees and returned to the original starting place.
